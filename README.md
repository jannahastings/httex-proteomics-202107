[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5469407.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5469407)

The repository contains the R code used in the analysis of proteomics data for HTT inclusions in neurons, one of the experiments reported in the article:

N. Riguet et al., "Nuclear and cytoplasmic huntingtin inclusions exhibit distinct biochemical composition, interactome and ultrastructural properties", Nature Communications 2021. 

The analysis uses the [DEP](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DEP/inst/doc/DEP.html) library for proteomics data.
